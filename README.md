# HELLO-WORLD
Hello All:-Here I will occasionally ask for help with code but as I am at the stage where I am about to build my first CNC router and buy my first 3D printer I will be asking for fair dinkum opinions from those who have been there before hopefully to save myself from too many pitfalls.
